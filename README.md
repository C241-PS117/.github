# About The Project

ESSY is an application designed to support educators in Indonesia by improving time management and assessment efficiency. In line with SDG 4 for Quality Education, ESSY aims to help educators focus on developing effective teaching techniques and providing tailored feedback. The application enables teachers to quickly and efficiently evaluate student assignments and exam results. This ensures that educators can spend more time on strategic educational planning. ESSY addresses the significant role of educators in creating quality students who can compete on an international level.

Our app aspires to simplify the process of evaluating essay-based exams, or assessments. Teachers can input exam questions and student responses through typing or image upload, and the application provides automatic grading. This feature saves teachers valuable time and enhances assessment efficiency. ESSY directly addresses the challenges teachers face in managing and grading large volumes of student work. By providing efficient assessment tools, ESSY aims to enrich the overall learning experience for both educators and students.
